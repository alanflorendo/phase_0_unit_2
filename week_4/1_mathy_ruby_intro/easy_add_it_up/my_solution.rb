# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# For each of the two functions the input is an array: an array of numbers for the total method and
# an array of strings for the sentence_maker method.

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# The total method will return a sum of the members of the inputted array.
# The sentence_maker method will return a concatenated sentence, made of the members of the inputted array.

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# Create total method with single argument: array_to_total
	# Declare new sum variable and set to zero
	# For each member of array_to_total, add to the sum variable
	# Return the sum variable

# Create sentence_maker method with single argument: array_of_strings
	# Declare new sentence variable and set to ""
	# For each member of array_of_strings, add to the sentence variable
		# if the member of the array is the first member of array_of_strings, capitalize it
	# End the sentence variable with a period
	# Return the sentence variable
