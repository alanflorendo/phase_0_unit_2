# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode
# Create total method with single argument: array_to_total
	# Declare new sum variable and set to zero
	# For each member of array_to_total, add to the sum variable
	# Return the sum variable

# Create sentence_maker method with single argument: array_of_strings
	# Declare new sentence variable and set to ""
	# For each member of array_of_strings, add to the sentence variable
	# Return the sentence variable



# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
