# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# an array of numeric grades

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# a single letter grade

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Create get_grade method with a single argument (grades_array)
	# Determine the average of the grades
		# Set a new variable called grades_total to zero
		# Add each grade in grades_array to grades_total
		# New variable average = grades_total divided by the array-length of grades_array
	# Use case statement to convert the average to a letter grade
