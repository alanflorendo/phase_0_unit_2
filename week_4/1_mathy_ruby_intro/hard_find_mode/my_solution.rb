# U2.W4: Calculate the mode!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# input is an array of numbers

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# output is an array of mode(s) (the number(s) occurring most often in the input array)

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# create a new method called mode, with single argument (input_array)
# create a hash variable called occurrences, with a default value of zero
# for each number in input_array, increment the value for that number key by 1
# create an array of all values from the hash (hash_value_array)
# create a variable num_mode_occurrences equal to the maximum of hash_value_array
# for each pairing in the hash, if the hash-value equals num_mode_occurrences, add its key to hash_value_array
