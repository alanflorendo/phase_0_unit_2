# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input:  a list of students
# Output:  a hash of those students with accountability groups
# Steps:


# 3. Initial Solution




# 4. Refactored Solution








# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE

	"m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]

puts "Test 1:  Test Group 1 for minimum size of 4"
puts "#{hash_value_min(new_ag_bracket(students)) >= 4}"

puts "Test 2:  Test Group 2 for minimum size of 4"
puts "#{hash_value_min(new_ag_bracket(students)) >= 4}"

puts "Test 3:  Test Group 3 for minimum size of 4"
puts "#{hash_value_min(new_ag_bracket(students)) >= 4}"

puts "Test 1:  Test Group 1 for maximum size of 6"
